# Encrypted Tokens (JWE)

A very large number of key and content encryption algorithms is provided by the library. Please refer to [this encryption algorithm table](encryption-algorithms.md) to know what algorithms are available.

Then, you will find an [example to create an encrypted token here](jwe-creation.md) and another [example to load and decrypt](jwe-loading.md) incoming tokens.
