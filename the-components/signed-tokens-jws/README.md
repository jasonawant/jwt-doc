# Signed Tokens (JWS)

A very large number of signature algorithms is provided by the library. Please refer to [this signature algorithm table](signature-algorithms.md) to know what algorithms are available.

Then, you will find an [example to create a signed token here](jws-creation.md) and another [example to load and verify](jws-loading.md) incoming tokens.
