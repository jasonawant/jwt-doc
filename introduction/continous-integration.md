# Continous Integration

The framework has been successfully tested using `PHP 8.1` with all algorithms.

Tests vectors from the [RFC 7520](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7520) are fully implemented and all tests pass. Other test vector sources may be used (e.g. new algorithm specifications).

We also track bugs and code quality using PHPStan and several extensions.

Coding Standards are verified by Easy Coding Standards.
