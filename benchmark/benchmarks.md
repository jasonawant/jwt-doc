# How To

You can easily check if an algorithm is fast enough on your platform. This project has tests for all operations with (almost) all algorithms.

## All algorithms

To run those tests, you must install the library with all dev dependencies. When done, just run the following command:

```bash
./vendor/bin/phpbench run --store
```

**The previous command will test ALL algorithms and may take more than 7 hours.**

## Algorithm Selection

We recommend you to run tests only for the algorithm(s) you want to use. Just run the following command:

```bash
./vendor/bin/phpbench run --group GROUP --store
```

The value of `GROUP` should be one of the following values:

* All signature algorithms: `JWS`
  * All HMAC algorithms: `hmac`
    * HS256: `HS256`
    * HS384: `HS384`
    * HS512: `HS512`
  * All Elliptic Curves algorithms: `ECDSA`
    * ES256: `ES256`
    * ES384: `ES384`
    * ES512: `ES512`
  * All Edwards-curve algorithms: `EdDSA`
    * Ed25519: `Ed25519`
  * All RSA algorithms: `RSASign`
    * RS256: `RS256`
    * RS384: `RS384`
    * RS512: `RS512`
    * PS256: `PS256`
    * PS384: `PS384`
    * PS512: `PS512`
* All key encryption algorithms: `JWE`
  * `KW`
    * A128KW: `A128KW`
    * A192KW: `A192KW`
    * A256KW: `A256KW`
  * `GCMKW`
    * A128GCMKW: `A128GCMKW`
    * A192GCMKW: `A192GCMKW`
    * A256GCMKW: `A256GCMKW`
  * `ECDHES`
    * ECDH-ES: `ECDHES`
    * `ECDHESKW`
      * ECDHESA128KW: `ECDH-ES+A128KW`
      * ECDHESA192KW: `ECDH-ES+A192KW`
      * ECDHESA256KW: `ECDH-ES+A256KW`
  * `PBES2`
    * PBES2-HS256+A128KW: `PBES2HS256A128KW`
    * PBES2-HS384+A192KW: `PBES2HS384A192KW`
    * PBES2-HS512+A256KW: `PBES2HS512A256KW`
  * `RSAEnc`
    * RSA1\_5: `RSA1_5`
    * RSA-OAEP: `RSA-OAEP`
    * RSA-OAEP-256: `RSA-OAEP-256`
* Note 1: the `dir` algorithm is not tested as there is no key encryption or key decryption with this algorithm.
* Note 2: tests consist in a full JWS/JWE creation and loading and sometimes using multiple key sizes.
* Note 3: for JWE creation and loading, each key encryption algorithm is tested with the following content encryption algorithms:
  * `A128GCM`, `A192GCM` and `A256GCM`
  * `A128CBC-HS256`, `A192CBC-HS384` and `A256CBC-HS512`

## Examples

Test all HMAC algorithms:

```bash
./vendor/bin/phpbench run --group hmac --store
```

Test the RSA1\_5 algorithm:

```bash
./vendor/bin/phpbench run --group RSA1_5 --store
```

## Benchmark Details

The result of the following command will only give you partial result. For example:

```bash
PhpBench 0.13.0. Running benchmarks.
Using configuration file: phpbench.json

............

12 subjects, 12 iterations, 12,000 revs, 0 rejects
(best [mean mode] worst) = 31.275 [86.783 86.783] 31.275 (μs)
⅀T: 1,041.395μs μSD/r 0.000μs μRSD/r: 0.000%
Storing results ... OK
Run: 133c8a853cf321f0b7b63e4e60f819f9910e1285
```

The main information is that the best algorithm takes only 31.275 µs... but you may need more information.

Just run the following command:

```bash
./vendor/bin/phpbench report --report=simple --output=md --uuid=133c8a853cf321f0b7b63e4e60f819f9910e1285
```

\*The value of the `--uuid` option is given at the end of the previous command. You can also use `latest`.

A `report.md` file will be created. It contains a detailed report (Markdown format). Example:
