# PHAR Application

## Installation

To install the application, you just have to download the PHAR file attached to the [release you need](https://github.com/web-token/jwt-app/releases).

You are free to distribute the file within your project or use it locally (e.g. `/usr/local/bin`).

To use it, just execute the following line:

```bash
./jose.phar
```

{% hint style="info" %}
You may need to set it as executable: `chmod +x jose.phar`
{% endhint %}
